# FindingNumberOfOrders_Using_MACHINE_LEARNING

Predicting the number of orders for a product is one of the strategies a business can follow in determining how much to invest in marketing their product. 
So, predicting the number of orders is an important data science use case for product-based companies.

If you want to predict the number of orders a company may receive for a particular product, then you need to have historical data about the number of orders received 
by the company. So for this task, I will be using the sales data of supplements that have been collected from Kaggle. The data that I will be using for the task of 
the number of orders prediction contains data about:

Product ID
Store ID
The type of store where the supplement was sold
The type of location the order was received from
Sales Date
Region code
Whether it is a public holiday or not at the time of order
Whether the product was on discount or not
Number of orders placed
Sales
